## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Thulakshana Dissanayake ! I'm passionate about software development and always eager to learn and take on new challenges.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing a service-oriented architecture (SOA) for a local tech repair shop, integrating WCF services for efficient inventory management and order processing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced ASP.NET Web Forms and WCF service configurations, along with diving deeper into database management with SQL Server and MySQL.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to web services, mobile app development, and cloud-based data solutions, especially in areas like e-commerce, data analytics, and small business management.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving my skills in front-end frameworks like React or Angular, and enhancing UI/UX design for web applications.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to ASP.NET, Android app development, database management, or service-oriented architectures. Iâ€™d be happy to share my experiences!
